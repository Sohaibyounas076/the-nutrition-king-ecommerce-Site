## SEO Optimization

Website build complete. Client asked if I could get the site to appear on Google. I showed the client an initial SEO audit. The audit showed many critical issues. The client was impressed and ordered SEO work.

Initial SEO problems included slow pages, weak meta tags, missing image alt text, and poor mobile experience. I created a step by step SEO plan. I implemented on page, technical, content, and off page fixes. Below are the screenshots showing before and after results, followed by traffic results.





**Initial Issues:**

- 13 critical issues affecting rankings
- 12 recommended fixes not implemented
- Poor metadata, slow loading, missing alt tags, poor mobile responsiveness
